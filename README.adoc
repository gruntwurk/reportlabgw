== The GruntWurk Family of Libraries/Projects

* `gwpycore` -- Classes and functions that augment fundamental features of Python.
* `kivygw` -- Extensions/helpers for the Kivy GUI framework.
* `reportlabgw` -- Extensions/helpers for the ReportLab PDF framework. *_<- You Are Here_*
* `general-tools` -- BASH script tools/libraries for building Linux boxes (e.g. *RaspberryPi* boxes; virtual machines via *Vagrant*), a reference library of *cheat sheets*, and more.
* `vscode-python` -- a *Visual Studio Code plugin* with 100's of commands and snippets for working with plain Python as well as these "GruntWurk for Python" enhancements.
* `sublime_gruntwurk_python` -- a *SublimeText 4* plugin with commands and snippets for working with plain Python as well as these "GruntWurk for Python" enhancements.

NOTE: Despite "`core`" being in the name, `gwpycore` is not a dependency of the other libraries, although they can certainly all work together.



== The GruntWurk Mission

The GruntWurk mission is to support open-source Python projects by making it easy for potential new contributors to jump on board.
As the name implies, we aim to take the grunt-work out of project development, hiding away the complexities so that contributors can immediately get down to business.
The shorter the learning curve, the easier it is for contributors to join in.
See link:/doc/GRUNTWORK.adoc[further details].


== Features

This `reportlabgw` package offers support for TODO


=== ReportLab Support

* So far, just a helper for registering TTF fonts.




== Be Aware

NOTE: This library was developed in Python 3.8 on Windows 10.
Everything should work in Python 3.6 and/or on non-Windows boxes, but no guarantees either way.
